    Water Availability Assessments (IWAAs) to capitalize on the operational and scientific strengths of 
    the USGS to support understanding and management of the nation’s complex water resource issues. In 
    this effort, IWAAs provides nationally and regionally consistent assessments of water for human and 
    ecological needs at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Determining trends in water availability is
    necessary to better understand the factors limiting water supply and use and inform forecasts of hydrologic extremes.
